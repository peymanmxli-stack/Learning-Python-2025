In this module, I learn how **ALT codes** work in Windows and how **special characters and emojis** can be printed and used in Python programs 🐍.

ALT codes allow me to type characters that are not easily accessible
on the keyboard, such as:
- box-drawing characters ║ ═ ─
- arrows ➜ ➤ ➡
- math symbols ± × ÷
- currency symbols € ¥ $
- special letters ñ ü ç
- emojis 😀 🔥 ✅ 🎯

These characters are especially useful for:
- 🖥️ console user interfaces
- 📐 ASCII / text-based layouts
- 📊 terminal dashboards
- 📋 menus and separators
- 🎓 educational tools and visual output

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable:
- understanding what ALT codes are
- knowing when ALT codes work (Windows + numeric keypad)
- printing special characters in Python
- using emojis in Python programs
- organizing characters by category
- building clean, readable, and expressive console output

## 😀 Emojis in Python (Very Important Section)

### 🔹 Can Python Print Emojis?
✅ **Yes!**  
Python fully supports emojis because Python strings use **Unicode**.
