Welcome to Module 03: Python Modules & Packages.
In this module, I learn how Python organizes code into modules and packages, which is a fundamental skill for writing clean,
scalable, and professional Python projects.

This module focuses on code organization, reusability, and project structure, 
moving from simple imports to real-world layouts used in production environments.

---
🎯 Learning Objectives

-By completing this module, I will be able to:
-Understand what a module is in Python
-Create and import custom modules
-Use built-in and third-party modules
-Understand the difference between modules vs packages
-Organize Python files using folders and __init__.py
-Use import, from ... import, and aliases properly
-Write clean, reusable, and maintainable code

---
🧠 Key Concepts Covered

🚀 Why This Module Matters

Modules and packages are the foundation of professional Python development.
Without them, projects become hard to read, hard to scale, and hard to maintain.

Mastering this module prepares me for:

Larger Python projects

Frameworks like Django & Flask

APIs and libraries

Team collaboration

Real-world software development

📌 Notes

This module is part of the Learning_Python_2025 repository

All modules follow the same structure and standards

Content progresses from beginner to professional level
