# 🧱 Module — Python Syntax

## ✨ Overview

This module introduces **Python syntax**, the set of rules that defines how
Python code must be written and structured.

Syntax is the foundation of all Python programs. Without correct syntax,
Python cannot understand or execute code. This module focuses on writing
valid, readable, and well-structured Python code, following best practices
used in real-world development.

Mastering syntax early helps prevent errors, improves readability, and
builds confidence when moving into more advanced topics like control flow,
functions, and object-oriented programming.

## 🎯 What I will learn in this module

By the end of this module, I will be able to:

- Understand what syntax is and why it matters in Python.
- Write valid Python statements and expressions.
- Use correct indentation to define blocks of code.
- Understand how Python uses colons (`:`) and indentation instead of braces.
- Write and use comments correctly.
- Follow Python naming rules for variables (identifiers).
- Recognize Python keywords and avoid using them incorrectly.
- Identify and fix common syntax errors.
- Write clean, readable code that follows basic style conventions.

## 📁 Module file structure

This module follows the same structure as the other modules in this repository:

### 📘 `Syntax_Notes.py`
Conceptual explanations of Python syntax rules, with commented examples
and best practices.  
This file focuses on **understanding how Python code is written**.

### 📂 `Syntax_Examples.py`
A collection of focused, runnable examples demonstrating correct syntax,
indentation, and code structure.

### 📝 `Syntax_Tasks.py`
Practice exercises organized by difficulty.  
I am expected to write my own solutions here before checking the answers.

### ✅ `Syntax_Tasks_Solutions.py`
One possible set of clean and professional solutions for each task, used
for review and comparison after attempting the tasks.

## 🧩 Difficulty and ranking system

Tasks and examples in this module follow a progressive ranking system:

**Rank 1 — Beginner**  
Basic syntax rules, printing, simple statements, and indentation.

**Rank 2 — Easy**  
Working with variables, expressions, and basic code blocks.

**Rank 3 — Intermediate**  
Combining multiple statements, loops, and conditional structures.

**Rank 4 — Advanced**  
Recognizing and fixing syntax errors, improving readability, and organizing code.

**Rank 5 — Professional**  
Writing clean, well-structured code that follows Python conventions and
best practices.

## ▶️ Suggested study workflow

To get the most out of this module, I will:

1. Read **Syntax_Notes.py** to understand Python’s syntax rules and structure.
2. Run and explore **Syntax_Examples.py**, observing how indentation and formatting affect behavior.
3. Complete all tasks in **Syntax_Tasks.py**, from Rank 1 to Rank 5, without checking solutions.
4. Review **Syntax_Tasks_Solutions.py** only after finishing the tasks:
   - If my solution works but looks different, that’s acceptable.
   - If my code is harder to read, I will refactor it using the provided examples.

## 🚀 What comes next

After completing this module, I will be ready to move on to:

- Control Flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions
- More complex program logic

A strong understanding of syntax makes all future Python topics easier
and more intuitive.
