# ===========================================================================
# 🟢 Rank 1 — Beginner
# ===========================================================================
# Understanding basic types


# Task 1:
# Create three variables:
# - an integer
# - a string
# - a boolean
# Print the value and type of each variable.


# Task 2:
# Assign a value to a variable and print its type.
# Reassign a value of a different type to the same variable
# and print the new type.


# Task 3:
# Use type() to check whether a variable contains a float.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟡 Rank 2 — Easy
# ===========================================================================
# Comparing and checking types


# Task 4:
# Create two variables with the same integer value.
# Print their ids and observe whether they are the same.


# Task 5:
# Create two variables with the same string value.
# Compare them using:
# - ==
# - is
# Print the results.


# Task 6:
# Use isinstance() to check if a variable is either
# an integer or a float.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟠 Rank 3 — Intermediate
# ===========================================================================
# Reasoning about object references


# Task 7:
# Create a list and assign it to another variable.
# Modify the list through one variable and print both variables.


# Task 8:
# Create a variable and store its id.
# Reassign the variable to a new value and print the new id.
# Observe the difference.


# Task 9:
# Write a function that prints the type of its argument
# only if the argument is NOT a string.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔴 Rank 4 — Advanced
# ===========================================================================
# Identity and safe type handling


# Task 10:
# Write a program that checks whether two variables
# reference the same object using 'is'.


# Task 11:
# Write a function that accepts one parameter.
# If the parameter is a number (int or float),
# return its square.
# Otherwise, return an error message.


# Task 12:
# Write a program that demonstrates the difference
# between value equality and identity.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔵 Rank 5 — Professional
# ===========================================================================
# Defensive and real-world type reasoning


# Task 13:
# Write a function that accepts any input and:
# - prints its value
# - prints its type
# - prints its id


# Task 14:
# Write a function that safely adds two values.
# Only allow numeric types.
# Use isinstance() for validation.


# Task 15:
# Write a program that processes a list containing
# mixed data types and prints only the numeric values.
