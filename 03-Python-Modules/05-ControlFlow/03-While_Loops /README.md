# 🔄 Control Flow — while Loops

## 📌 Overview
A `while` loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code **as long as a
condition remains True**.

Unlike `for` loops (which iterate over sequences), `while` loops are
**condition-driven**, making them ideal for:
- User input validation
- Repeating actions until a goal is reached
- Loops where the number of iterations is unknown

Understanding `while` loops is essential for writing **interactive,
dynamic, and responsive programs**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this section, I learned how to:

- Understand how `while` loops work
- Write condition-based loops
- Avoid infinite loops
- Use `break`, `continue`, and `else` with `while`
- Control loop flow using counters and flags
- Apply best practices for safe and readable loops

## 🧠 When to Use while vs for

| Use Case | Loop Type |
|--------|----------|
| Known number of iterations | `for` |
| Unknown number of iterations | `while` |
| User-driven loops | `while` |
| Iterating collections | `for` |

## ⚠️ Common Risks
- Infinite loops
- Forgotten condition updates
- Complex conditions that reduce readability

---

## ✅ Best Practices
- Always update the loop condition
- Use `break` for clear exits
- Prefer `for` loops when possible
- Keep conditions simple and readable
- Use flags for complex logic
