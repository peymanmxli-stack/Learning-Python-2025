# 🔁 Control Flow — for Loops

## 📌 Overview
`for` loops in Python are used to **iterate over sequences** such as lists,
tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets, and ranges.

They allow us to repeat actions in a **clear, readable, and Pythonic way**
without manually managing counters like in some other languages.

Python `for` loops are built on the concept of **iterables** and are one of
the most commonly used control-flow tools in real-world programs.

- Iterate over different data types
- Use `range()` effectively
- Access indexes with `enumerate()`
- Loop through dictionaries correctly
- Use `else` with `for` loops
- Write clean and readable loop-based logic

## ✅ Best Practices
- Prefer `for` loops over `while` when iterating
- Use descriptive variable names
- Avoid unnecessary nesting
- Use `enumerate()` instead of manual counters
- Use `break` and `continue` wisely
