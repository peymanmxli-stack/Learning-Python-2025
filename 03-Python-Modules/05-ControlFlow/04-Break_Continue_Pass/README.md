# ⛔ Loop Control Statements — break / continue / pass

## 📌 Overview
Loop control statements allow us to **change the normal flow of loops**
(`for` and `while`) in Python.

Python provides three main loop control keywords:

- `break` — immediately stops a loop
- `continue` — skips the current iteration and moves to the next one
- `pass` — does nothing (placeholder statement)

These statements are essential for writing **efficient, readable,
and flexible control-flow logic**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this section, I learned how to:

- Exit loops early using `break`
- Skip iterations using `continue`
- Use `pass` as a placeholder in incomplete logic
- Combine loop control with conditions
- Avoid common mistakes and misuse

## 🧠 Why These Matter
- Prevent unnecessary computations
- Improve performance
- Simplify complex logic
- Enable early exits and validations
- Support clean algorithm design

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
- Using `break` when `continue` is needed
- Forgetting loop termination conditions
- Misusing `pass` instead of proper logic
- Creating unreadable control flow

---

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use `break` for clear and intentional exits
- Use `continue` sparingly
- Use `pass` only as a temporary placeholder
- Keep loop logic readable and simple
