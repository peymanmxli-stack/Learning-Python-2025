# ===========================================================================
# 🟢 Rank 1 — Beginner
# ===========================================================================

# Task 1:
# Create a variable called "age".
# If age is 18 or greater, print "Adult".
# Otherwise, print "Minor".


# Task 2:
# Use a for-loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.


# Task 3:
# Use a while-loop to print numbers from 5 down to 1.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟡 Rank 2 — Easy
# ===========================================================================

# Task 4:
# Loop through numbers from 1 to 10.
# If the number is 5, stop the loop using break.


# Task 5:
# Loop through numbers from 1 to 5.
# Skip number 3 using continue.


# Task 6:
# Write a loop that runs 3 times.
# Use pass inside the loop body.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟠 Rank 3 — Intermediate
# ===========================================================================

# Task 7:
# Write a program that converts a list of strings to integers.
# Handle invalid values using try / except.


# Task 8:
# Write a function that divides two numbers.
# Handle division by zero using exception handling.


# Task 9:
# Use a with statement to open a file and write a message to it.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔴 Rank 4 — Advanced

# ===========================================================================

# Task 13:
# Use match / case to handle user commands:
# "start", "stop", "restart", and a default case.


# Task 14:
# Use a list comprehension to create a list of squares
# of numbers from 1 to 10, but only for even numbers.


# Task 15:
