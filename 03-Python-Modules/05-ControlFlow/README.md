# 🔀 Module — Control Flow in Python

## ✨ Overview

Control flow is the backbone of every Python program.  
It defines **how code executes**, **when decisions are made**, and **how repetition, errors, and logic paths are handled**.

In this module, I study Python’s control flow features from **basic decision-making** to **advanced flow constructs** used in professional, real-world codebases.

Mastering control flow allows me to:
- Write dynamic, intelligent programs
- Handle user input safely
- Build robust logic that reacts to data
- Structure programs clearly and maintainably

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, I will be able to:

- Control execution using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Repeat logic using loops (`for`, `while`)
- Manage loop behavior with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Handle runtime errors using exceptions (`try / except / finally`)
- Use context managers (`with`) for safe resource handling
- Control function execution using `return`, `yield`, and `raise`
- Apply modern pattern matching with `match / case`
- Write concise logic using comprehensions and ternary expressions

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ 1. Control Flow Basics
**(if / elif / else, for, while)**

- Conditional branching
- Boolean logic in decisions
- Iteration over sequences
- Infinite loops and loop termination

---

### 🔁 2. Loop Control Statements
**(break, continue, pass)**

- Exiting loops early
- Skipping iterations
- Placeholder statements for future logic

---

### ⚠️ 3. Exception Handling
**(try / except / else / finally)**

- Catching and handling errors safely
- Preventing program crashes
- Cleaning up resources properly
- Raising custom exceptions

---

### 📦 4. Context Managers
**(with statement)**

- Safe file handling
- Resource management
- Automatic cleanup
- Writing cleaner and safer code

---

### 🔄 5. Functions Flow Control
**(return, yield, raise)**

- Returning values from functions
- Creating generators with `yield`
- Raising errors intentionally
- Understanding execution flow inside functions

---

### 🧩 6. Pattern Matching
**(match / case)**

- Structural pattern matching (Python 3.10+)
- Cleaner alternatives to long `if / elif` chains
- Matching values, types, and structures

---

### ⚡ 7. Comprehensions & Ternary Expressions

- List, set, dict, and generator comprehensions
- Writing expressive one-line logic
- Conditional expressions (ternary operator)
- Balancing readability and conciseness

### File Purpose

- **ControlFlow_Notes.py**  
  Conceptual explanations with commented examples and best practices.

- **ControlFlow_Examples.py**  
  Runnable, focused examples demonstrating each control flow concept.

- **ControlFlow_Tasks.py**  
  Exercises organized from **Rank 1 (Beginner)** to **Rank 5 (Professional)**.

- **ControlFlow_Tasks_Solutions.py**  
  One possible set of clean, professional solutions for comparison and review.

## 🧩 Difficulty & Ranking System

Tasks and examples follow a progressive ranking system:

- 🟢 **Rank 1 — Beginner**  
  Simple conditions and loops.

- 🟡 **Rank 2 — Easy**  
  Loop control and basic exception handling.

- 🟠 **Rank 3 — Intermediate**  
  Combined logic, nested flows, and function control.

- 🔴 **Rank 4 — Advanced**  
  Context managers, generators, and error design.

- 🔵 **Rank 5 — Professional**  
  Pattern matching, comprehensions, and clean control-flow architecture.

---

## ▶️ Suggested Study Workflow

To get the most out of this module, I will:

1. Read **ControlFlow_Notes.py** carefully to understand concepts and rules.
2. Run and modify **ControlFlow_Examples.py** to observe behavior.
3. Solve all exercises in **ControlFlow_Tasks.py**, starting from Rank 1.
4. Review **ControlFlow_Tasks_Solutions.py** only after attempting the tasks.
5. Refactor my solutions for clarity, safety, and readability.

## 🚀 Why Control Flow Matters

Control flow is not just syntax — it is **how programs think**.

Strong control flow skills lead to:
- Fewer bugs
- Better error handling
- Cleaner architecture
- More readable and maintainable code

This module is a **critical foundation** for advanced topics such as:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Processing
- Web Development
- Automation and APIs
