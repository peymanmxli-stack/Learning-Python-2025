# 🧵 Module — Basic Data Types: Float

In this module I focus on Python’s **float** type — numbers with decimals, like `3.14` or `-0.5`.  
Floats are used everywhere: prices, measurements, grades, statistics, and many real-world calculations.

By the end of this module, I should feel comfortable creating, using, and reasoning about floating-point numbers in real code.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

- Understand what a float is and when to use it instead of an integer.
- Create float variables and use them in expressions.
- Perform common arithmetic operations with floats.
- Control how floats are displayed (rounding, formatting, etc.).
- Be aware of floating-point precision issues and how to deal with them.
- Write small, realistic examples that work with prices, averages, and measurements.

## 📁 Module File Structure

- **Float_Notes.py**  
  Explanations of the float type, examples, and comments about best practices.

- **Float_Examples.py**  
  Small, focused examples showing how floats are used in real Python code.

- **Float_Tasks.py**  
  Practice exercises, organized by difficulty (Rank 1 to Rank 5).

- **Float_Tasks_Solutions.py**  
  One clean, professional solution for each task, for review after I try them myself.

## 🧩 Exercise Difficulty Framework (Ranking System)

- **Rank 1 — Beginner**  
  Very simple float variables and basic arithmetic.

- **Rank 2 — Easy**  
  Simple calculations combining several floats (totals, averages, etc.).

- **Rank 3 — Intermediate**  
  Multi-step calculations with basic logic (conditions, small functions).

- **Rank 4 — Advanced**  
  More realistic problems (discounts, conversions, summaries, simple reports).

- **Rank 5 — Professional**  
  Small “production-style” utilities that work with floats cleanly and safely.

## ▶️ Recommended Study Workflow

1. Start with **Float_Notes.py** to understand the main ideas and see basic examples.
2. Run and explore **Float_Examples.py**, changing values and printing results.
3. Work through every exercise in **Float_Tasks.py** without looking at the answers.
4. After I’ve tried the tasks honestly, open **Float_Tasks_Solutions.py** and compare:
   - Check if my logic is correct.
   - Notice any more professional patterns I can adopt.
5. When I feel comfortable with floats, I can move on to the next module in the series.
