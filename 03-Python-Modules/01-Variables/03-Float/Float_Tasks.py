"""
📂 Module — Basic Data Types: Float (float)
📝 Tasks File

This file contains practice tasks designed to help me understand and master
floating-point numbers in Python. The tasks progress from basic usage to
more realistic, professional-level scenarios.

Important rules:
- I must attempt each task on my own.
- I should write clean and readable Python code.
- I should avoid looking at the solutions until I finish the tasks.

# ===========================================================================
# 🟢 Rank 1 — Beginner
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: creating and using float values


# Task 1.1
# Create a float variable called price and assign it a decimal value.
# Print the value and its type.


# Task 1.2
# Create two float numbers and print their sum.


# Task 1.3
# Convert an integer to a float and print the result.


# Task 1.4
# Create a float variable called temperature and print it with a message.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟡 Rank 2 — Easy
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: basic arithmetic and rounding


# Task 2.1
# Create two float numbers.
# Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# Print each result.


# Task 2.2
# Divide two integers and store the result in a variable.
# Print the value and its type.


# Task 2.3
# Use the round() function to round a float to:
# - 0 decimal places
# - 2 decimal places


# Task 2.4
# Convert a string representing a decimal number into a float.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟠 Rank 3 — Intermediate
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: precision, comparisons, and practical usage


# Task 3.1
# Add 0.1 and 0.2 and print the result.
# Check if the result is equal to 0.3 and print the Boolean result.


# Task 3.2
# Compare two float values using a tolerance (small difference).
# Print whether they are considered equal.


# Task 3.3
# Ask the user for a radius (float).
# Calculate and print the area of a circle.


# Task 3.4
# Ask the user for two float numbers.
# Print which one is larger.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔵 Rank 4 — Advanced
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: realistic calculations and formatted output


# Task 4.1
# Ask the user for a product price (float).
# Ask for a tax rate (float).
# Calculate and print:
# - tax amount
# - total price


# Task 4.2
# Ask the user for a distance (km) and time (hours).
# Calculate and print the average speed.


# Task 4.3
# Ask the user for a float number.
# If the number is greater than 0, print "Positive".
# If it is less than 0, print "Negative".
# Otherwise, print "Zero".


# Task 4.4
# Ask the user for a float value.
# Print the value formatted to exactly 2 decimal places.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔴 Rank 5 — Professional
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: reusable functions, clean logic, and best practices


# Task 5.1
# Write a function called calculate_total(price, tax_rate).
# The function should return the total price including tax.


# Task 5.2
# Write a function called is_close(a, b).
# The function should return True if two floats are close enough
# using a small tolerance value.


# Task 5.3
# Write a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# Formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32


# Task 5.4
# Write a small program that simulates a bank balance:
# - Start with a float balance
# - Apply a deposit and a withdrawal
# - Print the final balance formatted to 2 decimals


# Task 5.5
# Refactor repeated float calculations into reusable functions
# to improve readability and maintainability.
