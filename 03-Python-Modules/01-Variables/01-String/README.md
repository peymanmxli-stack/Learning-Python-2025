# 🧵 Module — Basic Data Types: String

✨ **Overview**

This module focuses on Python’s string type: how to create, inspect, modify, and use text in real programs.  
Strings are everywhere in software — user input, file content, API responses, error messages, logs, and more.  
Getting really comfortable with them is a big step toward writing professional Python code.

## 🎯 What I will learn in this module

By the end of this module, I will be able to:

- Create and use string literals with single, double, and triple quotes.
- Understand that strings are sequences of characters (indexing and slicing).
- Combine strings with concatenation and f-strings.
- Use common string methods (lower, upper, strip, replace, split, join, etc.).
- Work with whitespace and escape characters safely.
- Loop over strings and search for characters or substrings.
- Recognize that strings are immutable and what that means for performance and design.

## 📁 Module file structure

This module uses the same structure as the previous ones in this repository:

- `String_Notes.py`  
  Conceptual notes about strings, with small inline examples and comments.  
  This is the “theory plus mini-examples” file.

- `String_Examples.py`  
  A collection of focused, runnable examples that show how to use strings in  
  clean, realistic ways.

- `String_Tasks.py`  
  Practice exercises, organized by difficulty. I’m supposed to write my own  
  solutions here before looking at any answers.

- `String_Tasks_Solutions.py`  
  One possible set of solutions for each task, using clear and professional  
  Python code. This file is for review and comparison after I’ve tried the  
  tasks myself.

## 🧩 Difficulty and ranking system

Like other modules in this project, the tasks and examples are organized  
using a simple ranking system:

- **Rank 1 — Beginner**  
  Very simple string operations: basic printing, length, simple concatenation.

- **Rank 2 — Easy**  
  Working with indexing, slicing, and a few basic string methods.

- **Rank 3 — Intermediate**  
  Combining multiple operations (e.g., cleaning and splitting text, building  
  small messages, basic validation).

- **Rank 4 — Advanced**  
  More realistic problems: processing user input, normalizing text,  
  searching and counting patterns.

- **Rank 5 — Professional**  
  Small “real-world style” utilities: building formatted messages, simple  
  parsers, and reusable helper functions for strings.

---

## ▶️ Suggested study workflow

To get the most out of this module, I will:

1. Read through `String_Notes.py` to refresh the core concepts.
2. Run and experiment with `String_Examples.py`, changing values and observing  
   how the output changes.
3. Work through all tasks in `String_Tasks.py`, from Rank 1 up to Rank 5,  
   without opening the solutions.
4. Only after I’ve made a serious attempt, open `String_Tasks_Solutions.py`  
   and compare my approach with the provided one:  
   - If my solution works but looks different, that’s okay.  
   - If my code is harder to read, I can refactor it using ideas from the solutions.

## 🚀 What comes next

After this module, I will have covered:

- Integers (Module — Basic Data Types: Integer)
