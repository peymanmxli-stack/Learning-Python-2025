# 🧩 Module 01 — Variables & Data Types

This module introduces the foundations of Python 🐍  
Here, I learn how Python stores information, how variables work, and how
different data types behave when I use them in real code.

Variables are the building blocks 🧱 of every Python program. Understanding
them well is essential before moving on to more advanced topics.

## 📚 What I Learn in This Module

In this module, I work on:

- 🧠 Understanding what a variable is and how to create one
- 🔢 Learning how to store numbers, text, and logical values
- 🧪 Practicing the most common Python data types:
  - `int` — whole numbers
  - `float` — decimal numbers
  - `str` — text
  - `bool` — True / False
  - 📦 Collections: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- ✍️ Writing clear and readable code with good naming practices
- 🧩 Solving exercises that gradually increase in difficulty, from beginner
  to more realistic and professional-style examples

## 🏆 Difficulty Levels (Ranking System)

The exercises are organized into levels to help me progress step by step:

- **Rank 1 — Beginner 🌱**  
  Very simple exercises to get started.

- **Rank 2 — Easy 🙂**  
  Slightly more combined ideas, but still straightforward.

- **Rank 3 — Intermediate ⚙️**  
  Longer problems that require more reasoning.
