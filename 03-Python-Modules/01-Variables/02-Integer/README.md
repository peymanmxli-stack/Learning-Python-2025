#  🧵Module — Basic Data Types: Integer (int)

## ✨ Overview
Integers are one of the most fundamental data types in Python.  
They represent whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero) and are used in almost every program: loops, counters, conditions, ranges, indexes, arithmetic, timers, math formulas, and more.

Although integers seem simple, Python’s `int` type is extremely powerful and has important behaviors that developers must understand — including unlimited precision, type conversion, arithmetic operators, bitwise operations, and performance considerations.

This module explores integers in depth and prepares you to write clean, efficient, and mathematically correct Python code.
