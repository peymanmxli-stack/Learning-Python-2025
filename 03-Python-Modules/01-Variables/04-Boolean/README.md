🧵 Module — Basic Data Types: Boolean (`bool`)

✨ **Overview**

This module focuses on Python’s Boolean type: how to represent truth values, how Booleans are created and evaluated, and how they control the flow of programs.
Booleans are the foundation of decision-making in software — conditions, validations, permissions, loops, comparisons, and logic all depend on them.
Becoming comfortable with Booleans is essential for writing clear, correct, and reliable Python code.

🎯 **What I will learn in this module**

By the end of this module, I will be able to:

* Understand what Boolean values are and how `True` and `False` work in Python.
* Create Boolean variables directly and through comparisons.
* Use comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) to produce Boolean results.
* Work with logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine conditions.
* Understand truthy and falsy values in Python.
* Use Booleans in `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
* Control program flow using Boolean expressions.
* Write clear and readable conditional logic.
* Recognize common logical mistakes and avoid them.

📁 **Module file structure**

This module uses the same structure as the previous ones in this repository:

**Boolean_Notes.py**
Conceptual notes about Booleans, with small inline examples and comments.
This is the “theory plus mini-examples” file.

**Boolean_Examples.py**
A collection of focused, runnable examples that show how Boolean values and
logical expressions are used in real programs.

**Boolean_Tasks.py**
Practice exercises, organized by difficulty. I’m supposed to write my own
solutions here before looking at any answers.

**Boolean_Tasks_Solutions.py**
One possible set of solutions for each task, using clear and professional
Python code. This file is for review and comparison after I’ve tried the
tasks myself.

🧩 **Difficulty and ranking system**

Like other modules in this project, the tasks and examples are organized
using a simple ranking system:

**Rank 1 — Beginner**
Basic Boolean values, simple comparisons, and printing Boolean results.

**Rank 2 — Easy**
Using comparison operators and simple `if` statements.

**Rank 3 — Intermediate**
Combining multiple conditions with `and`, `or`, and `not`.

**Rank 4 — Advanced**
More realistic logic: input validation, access control, and decision trees.

**Rank 5 — Professional**
Real-world style logic: readable conditionals, guard clauses, validation
functions, and clean decision-making patterns.

▶️ **Suggested study workflow**

To get the most out of this module, I will:

* Read through **Boolean_Notes.py** to understand how Boolean logic works in Python.
* Run and experiment with **Boolean_Examples.py**, changing values and observing
  how decisions and outputs change.
* Work through all tasks in **Boolean_Tasks.py**, from Rank 1 up to Rank 5,
  without opening the solutions.
* Only after I’ve made a serious attempt, open **Boolean_Tasks_Solutions.py**
  and compare my approach with the provided one:

  * If my solution works but looks different, that’s okay.
  * If my code is harder to read, I can refactor it using ideas from the solutions.

🚀 **What comes next**

After this module, I will have covered:

* Strings (Module — Basic Data Types: String)
* Booleans (Module — Basic Data Types: Boolean)

This prepares me to fully understand **control flow**, including:

* Conditional statements
* Loops
* Input validation
* Program logic
