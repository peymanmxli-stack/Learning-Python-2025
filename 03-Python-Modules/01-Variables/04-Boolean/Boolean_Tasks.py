"""
📂 Module — Basic Data Types: Boolean (bool)
📝 Tasks File

This file contains practice tasks designed to help me master Boolean logic
in Python. The tasks are organized from very basic to professional-level
usage.

Important rules:
- I must try to solve each task myself.
- I should NOT look at the solutions while working.
- I should write clean, readable Python code.

# ===========================================================================
# 🟢 Rank 1 — Beginner
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: basic Boolean values and simple comparisons


# Task 1.1
# Create a Boolean variable called is_student and set it to True.
# Print its value and its type.


# Task 1.2
# Create two numbers and compare them using == and !=.
# Print the results.


# Task 1.3
# Check if the number 10 is greater than 5.
# Store the result in a variable and print it.


# Task 1.4
# Create a Boolean variable called is_online and set it to False.
# Print a message showing its value.


# ===========================================================================
# 🟡 Rank 2 — Easy
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: comparisons and simple if statements


# Task 2.1
# Ask the user for their age (as an integer).
# If the age is 18 or older, print "Adult".
# Otherwise, print "Minor".


# Task 2.2
# Create a variable score.
# If the score is greater than or equal to 60, print "Passed".
# Otherwise, print "Failed".


# Task 2.3
# Compare two strings and check if they are equal.
# Print the Boolean result.


# Task 2.4
# Create a Boolean variable called has_access.
# Use an if statement to print "Access granted" or "Access denied".


# ===========================================================================
# 🟠 Rank 3 — Intermediate
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: logical operators (and, or, not)


# Task 3.1
# Create two Boolean variables: is_logged_in and is_admin.
# Print True only if both are True.


# Task 3.2
# Ask the user for a number.
# Check if the number is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
# Print the result.


# Task 3.3
# Create a Boolean variable called is_banned.
# Use not to allow access only if the user is NOT banned.


# Task 3.4
# Check if a number is even AND greater than 10.
# Print the result.


# ===========================================================================
# 🔵 Rank 4 — Advanced
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: realistic conditions and validation logic


# Task 4.1
# Ask the user for a username and password.
# If the username is "admin" AND the password is "1234",
# print "Login successful".
# Otherwise, print "Invalid credentials".


# Task 4.2
# Ask the user for an email string.
# Check if it contains "@" and ".".
# Print whether the email looks valid.


# Task 4.3
# Ask the user for a number.
# Check if the number is NOT zero.
# Print whether division is safe.


# Task 4.4
# Create a variable temperature.
# If it is less than 0, print "Freezing".
# If it is between 0 and 25, print "Moderate".
# Otherwise, print "Hot".


# ===========================================================================
# 🔴 Rank 5 — Professional
# ===========================================================================
# Focus: clean logic, reusable code, and readability


# Task 5.1
# Write a function called is_even(number).
# The function should return True if the number is even, otherwise False.
# Test the function with different values.


# Task 5.2
# Write a function called can_login(is_active, is_verified).
# The function should return True only if both values are True.
# Test the function.


# Task 5.3
# Write a function called is_valid_password(password).
# Rules:
# - Password length must be at least 8 characters
# - Password must not be empty
# Return True or False.


# Task 5.4
# Write a small program that checks:
# - user is logged in
# - user has permission
# Use clear Boolean variables and readable logic.
# Print whether the action is allowed or denied.


# Task 5.5
# Refactor a complex condition into readable Boolean variables.
# Example idea:
# Instead of writing one long if statement,
# create intermediate Boolean variables that make the logic clear.
