Topic: Exception Handling — finally

Instructions:
- These tasks are ordered from Rank 1 (Beginner) to Rank 5 (Advanced).
- Do NOT write solutions in this file.
- Try to solve each task before checking the solutions file.
- Focus on understanding WHEN and WHY `finally` executes.
"""

# ==================================================
# Rank 1 — Understanding guaranteed execution
# ==================================================
# Task:
# Write a try/finally block that prints:
# - "Start"
# - "End"
#
# There should be NO except block.
# Prove that "End" prints even if nothing fails.

# TODO: Write your code here


# ==================================================
# Rank 2 — finally with handled exception
# ==================================================
# Task:
# Create a try block that divides two numbers.
# - Catch ZeroDivisionError
# - Print a custom error message
# - Use finally to print "Operation finished"

# TODO: Write your code here


# ==================================================
# Rank 3 — finally with return
# ==================================================
# Task:
# Create a function called `calculate()` that:
# - Returns a value from inside try
# - Uses finally to print "Cleanup before return"
#
# Call the function and observe the output order.

# TODO: Write your code here


# ==================================================
# Rank 4 — finally inside a loop
# ==================================================
# Task:
# Create a for loop from 0 to 4.
# Inside the loop:
# - Use try/finally
# - Break the loop when the value is 2
# - Print the loop value
# - Use finally to print "Loop cleanup"
#
# Observe how many times finally runs.

# TODO: Write your code here


# ==================================================
# Rank 5 — Real-world resource cleanup (Advanced)
# ==================================================
# Task:
# Simulate file handling WITHOUT using `with`.
#
# Requirements:
# - Open a file called "task_file.txt"
# - Write some text to it
# - Use try/finally to ensure the file is closed
# - Print a message confirming the file is closed
#
# BONUS:
# - Add an intentional error before closing the file
# - Confirm finally still runs

# TODO: Write your code here
