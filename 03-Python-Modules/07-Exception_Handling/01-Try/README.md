# 🚨 Exception Handling — The try Statement

The `try` statement is the foundation of Python’s exception handling system.
It allows a program to **test code for errors** without immediately stopping
execution when a runtime problem occurs.

Using `try`, we can safely protect critical operations such as:
- Mathematical calculations
- Type conversions
- File access
- User input
- External resources

This module focuses **only on understanding and using `try` correctly**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, I will be able to:
- Understand the purpose of the `try` block
- Identify code that should be protected with `try`
- Recognize common runtime errors
- Structure safe execution blocks
- Prepare code for proper exception handling

## ⚠️ Why `try` Is Important

Without `try`:
- A single error can crash the program
- User mistakes break execution
- Files and resources may remain open

With `try`:
- Programs become safer and more reliable
- Errors are anticipated and controlled
- Software behaves professionally

## 🧠 Key Concept

The `try` block **does not handle errors by itself**.
It only *marks code that might fail*.
Handling happens later using `except`, `else`, or `finally`.

---

## ✅ Best Practices

✔ Keep `try` blocks small  
✔ Protect only risky operations  
✔ Never wrap entire programs in `try`  
✔ Use `try` intentionally, not defensively  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Understanding `try` is the first step toward mastering exception handling.
It separates fragile scripts from resilient, production-ready applications.
