# 🚨 Exception Handling — The except Statement

The `except` statement is used to **handle errors** that occur inside a `try`
block. While `try` identifies risky code, `except` defines **how the program
should respond** when something goes wrong.

This module focuses on understanding:
- How `except` works
- Why specific exceptions matter
- How to structure clean and professional error handling

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, I will be able to:
- Understand the role of the `except` block
- Catch and handle runtime errors correctly
- Distinguish between different exception types
- Use multiple `except` blocks safely
- Write readable and maintainable error-handling code

## ⚠️ Why except Is Important

Without `except`:
- Errors crash the program
- Users see confusing tracebacks
- Software becomes unreliable

With `except`:
- Errors are handled gracefully
- Programs can recover or fail safely
- User experience improves significantly

---

## 🧠 Key Concept

The `except` block:
- Executes **only when an error occurs**
- Can target **specific exception types**
- Can capture error details for logging or messaging

---

## ✅ Best Practices

✔ Catch **specific exceptions** whenever possible  
✔ Avoid bare `except` in production code  
✔ Keep exception messages clear and meaningful  
✔ Handle only what you can recover from  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The `except` statement transforms Python programs from fragile scripts
into controlled, professional applications. Mastering it is essential
for real-world development.
