🚨 Multiple Except Blocks — Handling Errors Precisely

In Python, a single try block can produce different types of errors.
Using multiple except blocks allows us to handle each exception individually and safely.

Instead of treating all errors the same, Python allows us to:

Catch different exceptions separately
Apply different recovery logic for each error
Maintain clean and readable error-handling code
Avoid hiding bugs and unexpected failures

This module focuses on writing clear, precise, and professional exception-handling logic using multiple except blocks.

🎯 Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand how multiple except blocks work
Catch different exception types from the same try block
Control exception-handling order correctly
Understand why exception order matters
Avoid unreachable and incorrect exception blocks
Write clean, production-ready error-handling logic

⚠️ Why Multiple Except Blocks Matter

In real-world applications:

One operation can fail in multiple ways
Different errors require different responses
Generic error handling hides real problems
Poor exception order causes logical bugs

Using multiple except blocks prevents:

Catching the wrong exception
Executing incorrect recovery logic
Unreachable exception handlers
Confusing and unsafe error-handling code

🧠 Key Keywords

try
except
Multiple except blocks
Exception order
Specific vs generic exceptions
Exception hierarchy

✅ Best Practices

✔ Catch specific exceptions first
✔ Place generic except Exception blocks last
✔ Never duplicate exception handlers
✔ Keep each except block focused and clear
✔ Use hierarchy knowledge to control behavior

🏁 Conclusion

Multiple except blocks are essential for writing robust and professional Python software.
They allow precise control over error handling and prevent dangerous generic exception patterns.

Mastering this concept is a key step toward production-level Python development.
