📘 Multiple-Except-Blocks — Notes
🔹 What Are Multiple except Blocks?

In Python, a try block can raise different types of exceptions.
Using multiple except blocks allows us to handle each error type differently.

This is more professional, safe, and readable than catching all errors at once.

🔹 Basic Syntax
try:
    # risky code
except ValueError:
    # handle ValueError
except TypeError:
    # handle TypeError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # handle ZeroDivisionError


Python checks except blocks top to bottom and executes the first match.

🔹 Order Matters ⚠️

Specific exceptions must come before generic ones.

❌ Wrong:

try:
    x = int("abc")
except Exception:
    print("Generic error")
except ValueError:
    print("Value error")


✅ Correct:

try:
    x = int("abc")
except ValueError:
    print("Value error")
except Exception:
    print("Generic error")

🔹 Catching Multiple Exceptions in One Block
try:
    x = int(input("Enter number: "))
    y = 10 / x
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
    print("Invalid input or division by zero")

🔹 Using else and finally
try:
    x = int(input("Enter number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
else:
    print("Result:", result)
finally:
    print("Execution finished")

🔹 Best Practices

✔ Catch specific exceptions
✔ Keep handlers simple and clear
✔ Avoid empty except blocks
✔ Use finally for cleanup
✔ Never hide real errors
