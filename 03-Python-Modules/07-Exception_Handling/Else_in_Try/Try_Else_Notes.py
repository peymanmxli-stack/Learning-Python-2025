Topic: Exception Handling — try / else

This file contains STUDY NOTES explaining the purpose and behavior
of the `else` block in Python exception handling.

These notes focus on concepts, rules, and best practices
—not runnable exercises.

# ==================================================
# 1. What is `else` in try / except?
# ==================================================
# The `else` block is an optional part of exception handling.
# It executes ONLY if the `try` block completes successfully
# (meaning no exception was raised).


# ==================================================
# 2. Why `else` Exists
# ==================================================
# Beginners often place too much code inside `try`.
# This makes programs harder to debug and understand.
#
# The `else` block solves this by separating:
# - Risky code (in try)
# - Safe logic (in else)
#
# Rule:
# Only place code that might fail inside `try`.


# ==================================================
# 3. Basic Structure
# ==================================================
# try:
#     risky_code
# except SomeError:
#     handle_error
# else:
#     code_that_runs_only_if_no_error


# ==================================================
# 4. Execution Rules
# ==================================================
# - If try succeeds → else executes
# - If try fails → except executes, else is skipped
# - finally (if present) always executes
#
# Order is always:
# try → except → else → finally


# ==================================================
# 5. Common Use Cases
# ==================================================
# - Input validation
# - File operations
# - Type conversions
# - Database queries
#
# `else` is ideal for logic that depends on success.


# ==================================================
# 6. `else` vs `finally`
# ==================================================
# else:
# - Runs only when no exception occurs
# - Used for normal program logic
#
# finally:
# - Runs no matter what
# - Used for cleanup (closing files, releasing resources)


# ==================================================
# 7. Common Mistakes
# ==================================================
# ❌ Putting normal logic inside try
# ❌ Using else without except
# ❌ Using else for cleanup tasks


# ==================================================
# 8. Best Practices
# ==================================================
# ✅ Keep try blocks small
# ✅ Use else for post-success logic
# ✅ Combine else with finally when needed
# ❌ Avoid nested try blocks when possible


# ==================================================
# 9. Conceptual Example (Non-runnable)
# ==================================================
# try:
#     value = int(input())
# except ValueError:
#     print("Invalid input")
# else:
#     print(value * 2)
# finally:
#     print("End of operation")


# ==================================================
# 10. Key Takeaway
# ==================================================
# `else` improves clarity and structure in exception handling.
# It ensures that safe logic runs only when risky code succeeds.
