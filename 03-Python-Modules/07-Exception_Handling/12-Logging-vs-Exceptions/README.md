🚨 Logging vs Exceptions — When to Record Errors and When to Stop Execution

In professional Python software, not every problem should crash a program — and not every problem should be silently ignored.

Two critical tools help manage problems correctly:

Exceptions → Control program flow when something goes wrong

Logging → Record events, errors, and system behavior for analysis

This module explains when to raise exceptions, when to log, and how to combine both correctly.

🎯 Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:

Understand the difference between logging and exceptions
Know when to raise an exception
Know when to log an error or warning
Use Python’s built-in logging module
Combine logging with exception handling safely
Avoid common anti-patterns in production code

Logging_vs_Exceptions_Notes.py → Theory + explanations
Logging_vs_Exceptions_Examples.py → Practical examples
Logging_vs_Exceptions_Tasks.py → Exercises (Rank 1 → Rank 5)
Logging_vs_Exceptions_Tasks_Solutions.py → Correct solutions

⚠️ Why This Matters

In real-world systems:

Errors must be traceable
Systems must not crash unnecessarily
Developers must understand what happened later

Bad error handling causes:

Silent failures
Untraceable bugs
Security issues
Unstable systems

🧠 Key Keywords

logging
exception
raise
try / except
logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
traceback

✅ Best Practices

✔ Use exceptions to control incorrect program flow
✔ Use logging to record what happened
✔ Never replace exceptions with print statements
✔ Do not log and suppress critical exceptions
✔ Log context, not just error messages

🏁 Conclusion

Professional Python applications rely on a balance between logging and exceptions.
Understanding this balance is essential for building maintainable, debuggable, and reliable systems.
