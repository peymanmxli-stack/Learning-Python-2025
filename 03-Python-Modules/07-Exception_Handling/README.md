# 🚨 Exception Handling — try / except / else / finally

Exception handling allows a program to **detect, manage, and recover from runtime errors**
without crashing. It is a fundamental concept for writing **robust, secure, and professional**
Python applications.

Instead of stopping execution when an error occurs, Python gives us tools to:
- Handle predictable problems
- Protect critical code
- Provide meaningful feedback
- Clean up resources safely

This module introduces Python’s exception system from basics to best practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

By completing this module, I will be able to:
- Understand what exceptions are and why they occur
- Use `try` and `except` blocks correctly
- Handle specific exceptions safely
- Use `else` and `finally` properly
- Raise custom exceptions when needed
- Write defensive and production-ready Python code

## ⚠️ Why Exception Handling Matters

In real-world software:
- Users make mistakes
- Files may not exist
- Networks fail
- Inputs are unpredictable

Exception handling prevents:
- Program crashes
- Data corruption
- Poor user experience
- Security vulnerabilities

---

## 🧠 Key Keywords

- `try`
- `except`
- `else`
- `finally`
- `raise`
- Built-in Exceptions (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.)

---

## ✅ Best Practices

✔ Catch **specific exceptions**, not generic ones  
✔ Never silence errors without handling them  
✔ Use `finally` for cleanup (files, connections)  
✔ Use `raise` to signal real problems  
✔ Keep error messages clear and helpful  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Exception handling separates **beginner scripts** from **professional software**.
Mastering it is essential for writing safe, reliable, and maintainable Python code.
