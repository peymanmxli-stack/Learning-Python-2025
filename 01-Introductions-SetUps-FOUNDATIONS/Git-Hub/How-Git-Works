# 🔀 How Git Works — Commits, Branches & Pull Requests

This guide explains **how Git and GitHub track changes** using:
- Commits
- Branches
- Pull Requests

These concepts are essential for **professional software development**.

---

## 🧠 Big Picture (Simple Explanation)

Think of GitHub like a **timeline of your project**:
- Every change is saved
- You can go back in time
- You can experiment safely
- You can collaborate with others

Git achieves this using **commits**, **branches**, and **pull requests**.

---

## 📌 What Is a Commit?

A **commit** is a **saved snapshot** of your project at a specific moment.

Each commit:
- Records what changed
- Has a message explaining the change
- Is permanent in the project history

### 🔹 Example
```bash

git commit -m "Add variables module notes"
This means:

“I saved my work and described what I changed.”

---

🧠 When Should You Commit?

You should commit when:

A task is finished

A feature works

You fixed a bug

You want a restore point

📌 Commit often, but with meaning.

---

🌿 What Is a Branch?

A branch is a separate line of development.

Think of branches like:

Parallel versions of your project

Safe spaces to experiment

Independent work areas

The default branch is usually called: main

---

🔹 Why Use Branches?

Branches allow you to:

Test new ideas safely

Work without breaking main code

Develop features independently

---

🔹Creating a Branch
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature

Or in one command: git checkout -b new-feature
Now you are working outside main.
---

🔁 What Is a Pull Request (PR)?

A Pull Request is a request to:

“Please merge my changes into the main branch.”

Pull requests are created on GitHub, not in the terminal.

They allow:

Code review

Discussion

Approval before merging

---
🔹 Pull Request Workflow

-Create a branch

-Make changes

-Commit changes

-Push branch to GitHub

-Open a Pull Request

-Review & merge

🧩 How Everything Works Together
🧠 Simple Flow Example

main branch
   |
   |--- create branch (feature-x)
            |
            |--- commit changes
            |
            |--- push to GitHub
            |
            |--- open pull request
            |
            |--- merge into main
