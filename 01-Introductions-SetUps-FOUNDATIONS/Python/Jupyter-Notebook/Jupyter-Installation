# 📓 Installing & Using Jupyter Notebook (Professional Guide)

This document explains **how to install Jupyter Notebook correctly**, how to connect it with **`.venv` and VS Code**, and how to use it in a **professional GitHub Python project**.

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn Here

By following this guide, you will know how to:

* Install Jupyter safely
* Use Jupyter inside a virtual environment (`.venv`)
* Open and run notebooks in VS Code
* Select the correct Python kernel

This is the **recommended workflow for modern Python projects**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Rule (Read First)

✅ Jupyter must be installed **inside the project virtual environment**, not globally.

Why?

* Prevents dependency conflicts
* Keeps projects isolated
* Matches professional standards

---

## 🗂️ Starting Point (Example Project)

```
Desktop/
└── Learning_Python/
    ├── .venv/
    ├── notebooks/
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── README.md
```

Make sure you opened **Learning_Python** in VS Code.

---

## 🛠️ Step 1 — Activate the Virtual Environment

Open VS Code terminal and run:

### PowerShell

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You should see:

```
(.venv)
```

---

## 📦 Step 2 — Install Jupyter

With `.venv` activated:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

This installs:

* Jupyter Notebook
* Jupyter kernel support

---

## 📄 Step 3 — Save Dependencies

Always update `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This allows others to reproduce your environment.

---

## 🧩 Step 4 — Install Jupyter Extension in VS Code

1. Open **Extensions** in VS Code
2. Search for **Jupyter** (by Microsoft)
3. Install it

This enables `.ipynb` files inside VS Code.

---

## 🎯 Step 5 — Select the Correct Kernel (VERY IMPORTANT)

1. Open a `.ipynb` file
2. Look at the top-right corner
3. Click **Select Kernel**
4. Choose:

   ```
   Python (.venv)
   ```

Now Jupyter uses your project environment.

---

## ▶️ Step 6 — Run a Test Cell

Create a new notebook or open one, then run:

```python
print("Jupyter is working correctly")
```

If you see the output below the cell, everything is set up correctly.

---

## 🚀 Optional: Run Jupyter from Terminal

You can also start Jupyter manually:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This opens Jupyter in your browser using the same `.venv`.

---

## 🔁 Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Installing Jupyter globally
* ❌ Using global Python as kernel
* ❌ Forgetting to activate `.venv`
* ❌ Not saving `requirements.txt`

---

## 🏁 Final Checklist

* [x] `.venv` activated
* [x] Jupyter installed inside `.venv`
* [x] VS Code Jupyter extension installed
* [x] Kernel set to `.venv`

You are now working **like a professional Python developer**.
