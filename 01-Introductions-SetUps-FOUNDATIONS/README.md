# 🚀— Introductions, Setups & Foundations

Welcome to the **first module** of my Python learning journey in 2025!  
This foundational module prepares me with everything I need before diving into real Python coding.

In this module, I focus on:
- Setting up my learning environment 🖥️
- Installing Python and essential tools 🧰
- Understanding how to run code locally and on GitHub  📦
- Grasping core foundational concepts before real programming begins

## 📌 What’s Inside This Module

This module includes essential setup steps and orientation files that make the rest of the curriculum smooth and enjoyable.

Typical files included in this module:

- **Setup_Guide.md**  
  Instructions on installing Python, VS Code (or other editors), and configuring the environment.

- **GitHub_Tutorial.md**  
  Step-by-step instructions for using Git & GitHub with your Python projects.

- **FOUNDATIONS_Notes.py**  
  Python scripts with basic examples to test your setup.

- **FOUNDATIONS_Examples.md**  
  Simple examples & workflows to confirm everything is working.

*(If your module has other files you want included in this list, I can update this later😁.)*

## 🧠 Why This Module Matters

Before writing Python code, I first learn:

- How to install and verify Python on my computer 🧪
- How to use a code editor (VS Code / PyCharm / Nano / etc.)
- How to run Python files
- How to use Git and GitHub to track projects ✔️

This foundation makes everything else easier and more professional as I build real programs.

## 🧭 How to Study This Module

Recommended order:

1. 📥 Follow the **Setup_Guide.md** to install everything
2. 💻 Open your editor and run the sample code in **FOUNDATIONS_Notes.py**
3. 🔁 Practice committing and pushing to GitHub using **GitHub_Tutorial.md**
4. 📄 Try examples in **FOUNDATIONS_Examples.md**
5. 🎯 Confirm your environment is ready for Module 02 — Loops

Once I’m confident everything works, I can move on to the next module.

➡️ **Next Module:** `02-Loops 🔁`

## 👨‍💻 Notes & Tips

If you get stuck:
- Leave a message for me 💬
- Double-check your Python and editor configurations
- Make sure Git is authenticated for pushing to GitHub

Learning the development setup is just as important as learning the code itself!
